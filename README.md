# Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) system using Tensorflow.
Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) system using Tensorflow and trained on the IAM off-line HTR dataset. This Neural Network (NN) model recognizes the text contained in the images of segmented words as shown in the illustration below.

# Improvement from previous project [HTR](https://towardsdatascience.com/2326a3487cd5)
From the previous project, 5 layers CNN was used. But in my HTR, I will use 7 layers CNN in order to increase the accuracy.
